Touchpad disabler

2010.09.10

This disables the touchpad for a moment, when if there is activity in the
keyboard. Similar to syndaemon with the exception that the to-be disabled
pointer device does not have to be a synaptics touchpad. And this is much
simpler. Syndaemon is a part of the xf86-input-synaptics package:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-input-synaptics/

This was created, because the current (2.6.34-gentoo-r1) synaptics driver does
not support the touchpad that I have in my laptop:

And also I wanted to see if I could solve the behaviour of my irritating
touchpad with few hours of hacking ;)

Compilation:
